How to improve performance of neural network?
=>1)Fine tune the hyper parameters like the number of hidden layers,number of neurons per layer,learning rate,optimizer,Batch size,Activation function,epochs
  2)By solving problems:-
         i)Vanishing/Exploding Gradient Problem
         ii)Not enough data
         iii)slow training
         iv)Overfitting
